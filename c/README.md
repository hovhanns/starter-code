C starter code!
----------------

This is a starter code project for C projects.

You will need to have a newish version of `gcc`, `gnu make`.
If you are missing any of these things then install them 
using `apt-get`, assuming a `debian` based system.

# Running the code

To compile the code, you can just invoke `make`.

```
$ make
```

This will make a binary called `iterate_program`

You can run the program like so:

```
$ ./iterate_program
```

Clean up your junk with:

```
$ make clean
```

Happy hacking!
